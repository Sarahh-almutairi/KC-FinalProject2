    <h2>People experience a wide range of health effects from being exposed to air pollution.
        <br>
         Effects can be broken down into short-term effects and long-term effects.
<br>
        Short-term effects, which are temporary, include illnesses such as pneumonia or bronchitis.
        <br> They also include discomfort such as irritation to the nose, throat, eyes, or skin.
        <br>
         Air pollution can also cause headaches, dizziness, and nausea. 
         <br>
         Bad smells made by factories, garbage, or sewer systems are considered air pollution, too. 
         <br>
         These odors are less serious but still unpleasant.
        <br>
        Long-term effects of air pollution can last for years or for an entire lifetime.
        <br>
        They can even lead to a person's death. Long-term health effects from air pollution include heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Air pollution can also cause long-term damage to people's nerves, brain, kidneys, liver, and other organs.
        <br>
        Some scientists suspect air pollutants cause birth defects.
        <br> Nearly 2.5 million people die worldwide each year from the effects of outdoor or indoor air pollution.
        <br>
        People react differently to different types of air pollution. 
        <br>
        Young children and older adults,
         whose immune systems tend to be weaker, are often more sensitive to pollution. Conditions such
          as asthma, heart disease, and lung disease can be made worse by exposure to air pollution. The
           length of exposure and amount and type of pollutants are also factors.</h2>
