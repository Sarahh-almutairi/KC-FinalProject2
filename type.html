    <h2>The major forms of pollution are listed below along with the particular contaminants relevant to each of them:
<br><br>
        Air pollution: 
        <br>
        <img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/7/7c/Report-Environmental-Law-Violations-Step-2.jpg/v4-459px-Report-Environmental-Law-Violations-Step-2.jpg" alt="">
       <br>
        the release of chemicals and particulates into the atmosphere. Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. Photochemical ozone and smog are created as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to sunlight. Particulate matter, or fine dust is characterized by their micrometre size PM10 to PM2.5.
        <br><br>
        Electromagnetic pollution:
        <br>

        <br>
        the overabundance of electromagnetic radiation in their non-ionizing form, such as radio and television transmissions, Wi-fi etc. Although there is no demonstrable effect on humans there can be interference with radio-astronomy and effects on safety systems of aircraft and cars.
        <br><br>
        Light pollution:
        <br>

        <br>
        includes light trespass, over-illumination and astronomical interference.
        <br><br>
        Littering: 
        <br>

        <br>
        the criminal throwing of inappropriate man-made objects, unremoved, onto public and private properties.
        <br><br>
        Noise pollution: 
        <br>
        <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.60c9c0b04fb850d9dced3d9a52fe370d?rik=iwdr3dccU6shgQ&riu=http%3a%2f%2f1.bp.blogspot.com%2f-17oglZvWSG8%2fVlwhAAQ4L9I%2fAAAAAAAAAB8%2fohl9XlRkA7U%2fs1600%2fUntitled1.jpg&ehk=Vu7IkPZPsd%2fg%2bVoqcL9A%2ffVMMyl7zWojkCZHRAoEyfc%3d&risl=&pid=ImgRaw&r=0" alt="">
        <br>
    
        which encompasses roadway noise, aircraft noise, industrial noise as well as high-intensity sonar.
        <br><br>
        Plastic pollution:
        <br>
        involves the accumulation of plastic products and microplastics in the environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, or humans.
        Soil contamination occurs when chemicals are released by spill or underground leakage. Among the most significant soil contaminants are hydrocarbons, heavy metals, MTBE,[8] herbicides, pesticides and chlorinated hydrocarbons.
        Radioactive contamination, resulting from 20th century activities in atomic physics, such as nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons research, manufacture and deployment. (See alpha emitters and actinides in the environment.)
        Thermal pollution, is a temperature change in natural water bodies caused by human influence, such as use of water as coolant in a power plant.
        Visual pollution, which can refer to the presence of overhead power lines, motorway billboards, scarred landforms (as from strip mining), open storage of trash, municipal solid waste or space debris.
        Water pollution, caused by the discharge of industrial wastewater from commercial and industrial waste (intentionally or through spills) into surface waters; discharges of untreated sewage and chemical contaminants, such as chlorine, from treated sewage; and releases of waste and contaminants into surface runoff flowing to surface waters (including urban runoff and agricultural runoff, which may contain chemical fertilizers and pesticides, as well as human feces from open defecation).</h2>
